# Shairport Sync Docker

Run the [Shairport Sync](https://github.com/mikebrady/shairport-sync) service in a Docker container. This is a minimalistic setup that only includes the `shairport-sync` and `nqptp` services. Clone the repo and run `make up` to start, and `make down` to stop everything.

> [!NOTE]
> This setup was only tested on the Raspberry Pi image but should work on other Linux distributions  that have [Docker](https://docker.com) and [Avahi](https://avahi.org/) installed.
